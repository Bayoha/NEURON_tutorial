#### Instructions

In order to use this tutorial, you need to install NEURON ([How_to_Install_NEURON.txt](https://github.com/orena1/NEURON_tutorial/blob/master/How_to_Install_NEURON.txt)); after installing NEURON, you can decide whether to use jupyter notebook or Python scripts.

You will also need to compile to mod files. 
For example, if you decide to use the Jupyter_notebooks

Linux/Mac:
1. Open Terminal
2. Go to Jupyter_notebooks directory
3. Type: nrnivmodl mods

Windows:
1. Move all files from the folder [mods](https://github.com/orena1/NEURON_tutorial/tree/master/Jupyter_notebooks/mods) to the [base-directory](https://github.com/orena1/NEURON_tutorial/tree/master/Jupyter_notebooks)
2. Use the [following instructions](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/nmodl/mswin.html) (second section - Compiling mod files in NEURON 5.1 and later), choose the base-directory that now contains all the mod files

After completing the installations download the **[NEURON_tutorial.pptx](https://github.com/orena1/NEURON_tutorial/raw/master/NEURON_tutorial.pptx)** and follow the instructions in the presentation. Suggested exercises are available in the slides notes (The presentation is also available here: https://1drv.ms/p/s!ApfBr7JWIT35mj3A1Sjcw3hKNCdF?e=4yG34n)
